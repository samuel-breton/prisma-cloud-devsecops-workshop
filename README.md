# DevSecOps with Prisma Cloud

[![checkov](https://github.com/samuel-breton/prisma-cloud-devsecops-workshop/actions/workflows/checkov.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/samuel-breton/prisma-cloud-devsecops-workshop/actions/workflows/checkov.yml)

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevSecOps to automate, scale, and improve the security posture of your cloud infrastructure. We’ll create a pipeline that provides frequent, easy-to-digest improvements to ensure our configurations are secure and compliant from the build-time to runtime. You will integrate Prisma Cloud (and checkov) with Terraform Cloud, GitHub, VScode and AWS.
